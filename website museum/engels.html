                <p>A garage box in The Hague is the place where the adventure started in 2008, with two friends Hasan
                    Tasdemir and Pascal Rappailles. The garage quickly became too small, after which they moved to a shed
                    in an industrial area. Unfortunately, the shed was not heated and everything had to be done in the middle of winter
                    transferred to an empty Ministry of Agriculture. When this building also had to be emptied
                    the then collection of 10 arcade video games with some spare parts was stored
                    in an old showroom for classic cars. Because there was no room to renovate the cabinets or
                    suitable space was looked for to play. It was found in 2011 at Cobaltstraat
                    Zoetermeer.</p>
